# City Guide

A simple IP-based city guide, returning weather, location and business data based on a provided
IP address.

## APIs

- https://openweathermap.org/current

## Story

Using IP-API we first attempt to geolocate the user based on IP. If we were building
a real app and wanted more accurate data, we might even accept lat/lon coordinates
provided by a location API in the user's phone or browser. We parse this data to
get a zip code, then pass that to OpenWeatherMaps for information about the weather.
We also send the zip to Yelp for some suggested places to eat. We conform this to
a relatively simple GraphQL response, tailored to the use of the calling application.

## Query

IPs to try:

- `71.125.44.185` -> Brooklyn, NY
- `50.108.37.106` -> Muskegon, MI
- `128.218.229.26` -> San Francisco

```graphql
query GetCityGuide {
  getCityGuide(ip: "50.108.37.106") {
    location {
      city
      zip
    }
    weather {
      name
      weather {
        id
        main
        description
      }
    }
    businessList {
      name
      url
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

1. Install this pattern
2. Add your own authentication data to the service objects provided by the pattern. Yelp requires a bearer token, and OpenWeatherMap requires an API key identified by the query params `appid`.
3. Run the query above in the API Explorer, using one of the provided IPs or another IP.
